**Forced March** For each additional hour of travel beyond 8 hours, the characters cover the distance shown in the Hour column for their pace, and each character must make a constitution saving throw at the end of the hour. The DC is 10+1 for each hour past 8 hours. On a failed saving throw, a character suffers one level of exhaustion.
